=======
The first version of this project was published by `logx <http://logx.ecdesa.com/sw/de-prufung>`_
(same author of `Memória de Cálculo <https://github.com/memoriadecalculo>`_) between March and August of 2012 using
`GoogleCode SVN repository <http://code.google.com/p/de-prufung/>`_.

This version was developed under `GPL versão 3 <http://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_General_Public_License>`_ license.

Basically, it was developed using the `Python <https://www.python.org/>`_ as backend and
`Glade <https://glade.gnome.org/>`_ as frontend for `Symbian <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbian>`_ Operating System using
`PyS60 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_for_S60>`_ library.

It was automatically migrated to GitHub by `SymbiSoft <https://github.com/SymbiSoft/de-prufung>`_
in March of 2012.

And in February of 2019, it was forked here.
